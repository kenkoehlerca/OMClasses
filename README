Purpose:

This project is to integrate landing pages with the CRM Order Machine.  The pages contained in this project 
support landing pages such that the consumer is buying 1 item.  If a shopping cart solution is required 
then please contact support.  

This project is the initial conversion of a large non-object oriented template site into an object oriented project.  
Complete functionality is not yet included in this object oriented project in regards to consuming all web 
services available by the host.  
Functionality will be added as required by clients and management.

The code in consumer pages, such as index.php, is purposefully kept very simple from a design stand point.  
The assumption is that the client will design their landing pages.  
Processing a sale is trivial using the php classes.

Prerequisites:
Installation of CURL is required for the php scripts to work.  
These scripts were tested on Ubuntu Lucid.

Primary Files:
1)	BaseClass.php – sets username, password and target url for orders.  Also sets system wide parameters.
2)	ItemClass.php extends BaseClass- contains methods for obtaining information on items
3)	OrderClass.php extends BaseClass – contains methods for processing an order.
4)	Order.php – long form with customer data and questions.  An itemNum is required as a get or post variable.
5)	Quickbuy.php – simply for reviewing items.  Note the use of the $findme variable.  
        It can be used to reduce the items displayed on the page
6)	Orderconfirmation.php – displays the order id and customer id on a successful order.
7)	Order-status.php – gets the status of a previous order
